            <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
            <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> September 14, 2025</p>
            <p>We are confident that the Luxanta Digital Empire Kit provides immense value. We offer a <strong>30-day action-based money-back guarantee</strong>. We are not just selling you products; we are providing a business blueprint, and our guarantee applies to those who put in the work.</p>
            
            <h2>Eligibility for a Refund</h2>
            <p>Due to the digital nature of our products and the instant access provided, our refund policy is strictly action-based. To be eligible for a refund, you must meet the following conditions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You must have purchased the product within the last 30 days.</li>
                <li>You must demonstrate that you have implemented the strategies taught in our Digital Empire Masterclass for a period of at least <strong>120 days straight</strong> from the date of purchase.</li>
                <li>You must provide proof that you have made a genuine effort to build your business using our system and have not made back your initial investment.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What constitutes a "genuine effort"?</h2>
            <p>Proof of action includes, but is not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A link to your live, functioning landing page/sales funnel built using our training and templates.</li>
                <li>Screenshots of your social media profiles (e.g., Instagram, TikTok) showing consistent video content being uploaded as taught in the course.</li>
                <li>Evidence of marketing efforts, such as ad campaigns or consistent organic posting, as outlined in the masterclass.</li>
            </ul>
             <p>Simply purchasing and not taking action does not qualify for a refund. This policy is in place to protect our intellectual property and to ensure that we are working with customers who are serious about building a business. The guarantee is for those who try, not for those who simply buy.</p>

            <h2>How to Request a Refund</h2>
            <p>If you have met all the above criteria, please email our support team at <a href="mailto:official.luxanta@gmail.com">official.luxanta@gmail.com</a> with the subject line "Refund Request" and include all necessary proof of action. Our team will review your request within 5-7 business days.</p>
